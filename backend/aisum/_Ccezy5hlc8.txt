Coding requires a lot of practice. Python is a great programming language for beginners because it's easy to understand. Don't worry if you forget the syntax; with time and usage, you'll remember it. Everyone makes mistakes while coding, and that's normal. Errors are a part of learning programming. We learn Python because it's widely used and has many resources available. To get better at coding, practice consistently by writing the same code multiple times. This helps you remember the syntax and improves your problem-solving skills. Overall, keep coding, ask questions, and you'll improve!
