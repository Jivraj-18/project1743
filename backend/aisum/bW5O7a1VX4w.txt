This text discusses sets, their definitions, operations, and examples. A set is a collection of items, often written in curly braces. Finite sets can list all elements, while infinite sets use ellipses (like 1, 2, 3, ...) to indicate continuation. Membership is shown by ‘x ∈ X’, meaning x is an element of set X. A subset means all elements of one set are included in another set, illustrated using Venn diagrams. The power set contains all subsets of a given set, including the empty set.

Set comprehension is introduced as a way to describe infinite sets. For example, to find the squares of even integers, we can generate integers, filter for even numbers, and then square them. We can also create sets of rational numbers in reduced form by ensuring the numerator and denominator have no common divisors.

The text provides examples of using set comprehension for natural numbers and perfect squares, illustrating how to express complex sets concisely. It emphasizes understanding the generator, filter, and transformation in set definitions. Overall, set comprehension allows for clearer and more compact representations of sets.
