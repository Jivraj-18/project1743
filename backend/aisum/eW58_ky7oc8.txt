In this lecture, we discussed how to use the Python 'calendar' library and different ways to import libraries in Python. 

1. **Basic Import**: You can import a library using `import calendar`. This allows you to access functions like `calendar.month(year, month)` to get the calendar for a specific month and year.

2. **Importing Entire Library**: You can use `from calendar import *` to import everything from the calendar library, letting you call functions directly without the 'calendar.' prefix.

3. **Importing Specific Function**: If you only need one function, use `from calendar import month`. This way, you can use `month(year, month)` directly, but you canâ€™t use other parts of the library without importing them.

4. **Using Aliases**: You can import a library or function with an alias using `import calendar as c` or `from calendar import month as m`. This can make your code shorter and easier to read.

In summary, there are multiple ways to import libraries in Python, and knowing these methods helps you write cleaner and more efficient code.
