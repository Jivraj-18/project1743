We started with natural numbers and integers, then learned about rational numbers, which are numbers that can be written as a fraction (p/q) where p and q are integers. Rational numbers are dense, meaning between any two rational numbers, there is always another rational number. However, not all numbers on the number line are rational. For example, the square root of 2 is not a rational number, even though it can be represented as a length. This type of number is called an irrational number. Real numbers include both rational numbers and irrational numbers like the square root of 2, pi, and e. Real numbers are also dense. Lastly, we mentioned complex numbers, which extend real numbers to include square roots of negative numbers, but we won't cover them in this course. In summary, numbers can be organized into a hierarchy: Natural numbers -> Integers -> Rational numbers -> Real numbers, with complex numbers being another category we won't explore.
