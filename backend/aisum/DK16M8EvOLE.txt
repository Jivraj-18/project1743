In week 2 of our Python course, we focused on the basics of the language, including its syntax and grammar. We learned how to declare variables using the 'bucket' example and explored the powerful 'if' statement. You wrote a program for the Caesar Cipher, which shifts text to make it unreadable until it's shifted back. We also discussed strings, which are important in Python, and you should now feel confident using them. Additionally, we covered how to use the 'import' function to bring in libraries, like 'random' and 'math', which gives you access to many useful functions without needing to store everything on your computer. There are many libraries available for various tasks, and we'll explore more of them in future weeks. Week 3 will dive deeper into Python syntax, so stay tuned!
