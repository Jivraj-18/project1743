In the first week of Mathematics for Data Science, we learn about numbers, specifically natural numbers and integers. Natural numbers start from 0 and include 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., while integers include both positive and negative whole numbers (like -1, -2, ..., 0, 1, 2, ...). 

We can perform basic operations on natural numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, subtraction can lead to negative results, so we introduce negative numbers to create integers. 

Multiplication can be seen as repeated addition (e.g., 7 times 4 means adding 7 four times), and division can be thought of as repeated subtraction (e.g., dividing 20 mangoes among 5 friends means subtracting 5 until we reach zero). 

Factors are numbers that divide another number evenly. A prime number is a number that has only two factors: 1 and itself. We can find all prime numbers up to a certain number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes method, where we cross out multiples of primes. 

Lastly, every integer can be uniquely factored into prime numbers, which is important for understanding how numbers relate to each other.
