A function is a rule that connects inputs to outputs. For example, a function named g takes a number x and gives x squared as an output. Functions have three main parts: 
1. **Domain** - the set of all possible inputs. 
2. **Codomain** - the set of all possible outputs. 
3. **Range** - the actual outputs produced by the function. 

For example, the function g(x) = x² has a domain and codomain of all real numbers, but its range is only non-negative numbers (0 and above). 

Functions can also map non-numerical inputs, like mapping a person to their mother. 

We often study the range of outputs from functions, such as:
- **Quadratic functions** (like g(x) = x²) always yield positive outputs.
- **Cubic functions** can produce both very large positive and negative outputs.
- **Trigonometric functions** like sine oscillate between fixed values (e.g., between -1 and 1).

We also look for local minimum and maximum values, which are points where the function either reaches its lowest or highest value in a nearby area. For instance, g(x) = x² has a minimum at 0, while cubic functions can have multiple local maxima and minima.

Another key aspect is the growth rate of functions. For example, if we compare g(x) = x² with another function like h(x) = x³, h grows faster than g as x increases. This is important in real-life applications, such as comparing the growth of job opportunities in data science with the number of graduates in that field.

In summary, we study functions focusing on their properties like range, local extrema, and growth rates.
