In this Python lecture, we learned about variables and literals. We used a simple program to show how to ask for a user's name, location, and age, and then print a message using that information. 

1. **Variables** are like containers that can store different values (e.g., name, age). You can change what is stored in a variable anytime (like changing the name from Sudarshan to Omkar).

2. **Literals** are the actual values stored in variables (like 'Sudarshan', '40', 'Mysore').

3. You can combine print and input commands to display a message while asking for input.

4. When using variables, they can be on both sides of an equal sign, but literals can only be used on the right side.

5. We also discussed when to use variables (when values may change) versus literals (when values are constant, like Pi = 3.14).

In summary, variables are for changeable data, and literals are for fixed values. Happy learning!
