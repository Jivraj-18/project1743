In this content, we discuss how to represent lines in a coordinate plane, focusing on horizontal and vertical lines. A horizontal line is defined as one that is parallel to the x-axis, represented by the equation y = a, where 'a' is the y-coordinate. A vertical line is parallel to the y-axis and is represented by x = b, where 'b' is the x-coordinate. To uniquely define a line, we use a point and a slope; this leads to the point-slope form of a line's equation. Additionally, we can find a line's equation using two points through the two-point form. We illustrate these concepts with examples, showing how to derive line equations using known points and slopes.
