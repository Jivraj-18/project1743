In this lecture, we learned about escape characters and how to use quotes in Python. 

1. **Escape Characters**: These are used to include special characters in strings. For example, if you want to include a single quote in a string that is also enclosed in single quotes, you use a backslash (\) before the quote: 
   - Example: To print "It's a beautiful day," you write: `print('It\'s a beautiful day')`.
   - Similarly, to include double quotes in a string, use: `print("We are from IIT Madras")`.
   - You can also use `\t` for a tab space and `\n` for a new line.

2. **Using Quotes**: Python supports three types of quotes: single ('), double ("), and triple (''' or """). 
   - Single and double quotes are used for single-line strings. 
   - Triple quotes are used for multi-line strings. For example: 
     ``` 
     z = '''First line
Second line
Third line''' 
     print(z) 
     ```
   - Triple quotes can also be used to write multi-line comments without using the hash (#) for every line.

In summary, escape characters help manage special characters in strings, while different types of quotes allow for flexibility in defining strings, especially multiline ones.
