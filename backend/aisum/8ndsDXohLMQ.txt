Programming is like learning a new language to communicate with computers. Just like you need to know German in Germany or Hindi in India, you need a programming language to talk to computers. We focus on Python because it's popular, easy to learn, and powerful. In the past, learning to code took a long time, but now you can start coding in just a few hours with Python. 

Programming is fun because it allows you to make computers do complex tasks quickly. We will teach you step by step, assuming you know only basic English. Just like learning to drive a car requires practice, learning programming requires you to start coding right away. Throughout the course, we encourage you to code along with us as we teach you. In the first week, we'll keep things simple and repetitive to help you get comfortable with coding.
