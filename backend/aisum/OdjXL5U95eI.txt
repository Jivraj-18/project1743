In this lesson, we explore how to use a scientific calculator and Python's math library for mathematical functions. We learned how to perform operations like square roots, sine calculations, and factorials using a calculator. Then, we transitioned to Python, where we used the 'math' library to perform similar calculations. Importing this library is like borrowing a book from a library; you need to do it to access its functions. We also introduced the 'random' library to generate random numbers, which we used to simulate a coin toss and the roll of two dice. This demonstrated how programming can simulate random events and perform mathematical operations, highlighting the importance of library functions in Python.
