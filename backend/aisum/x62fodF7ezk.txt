To find the area of a triangle formed by three non-collinear points in a coordinate system, follow these steps:

1. Identify the coordinates of the triangle's vertices as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3).
2. Visualize the triangle and drop perpendiculars to the x-axis to create trapeziums around the triangle.
3. The largest trapezium (ADFC) helps to calculate the area of the triangle by subtracting the areas of two smaller trapeziums (ADEB and BEFC).
4. The area of a trapezium is calculated as:
   Area = 1/2 * (sum of parallel sides) * height.
5. For trapezium ADFC, the parallel sides are lengths AD and CF, and the height is the distance DF.
6. Calculate the areas of the trapeziums and subtract to find the area of triangle ABC.
7. The final formula for the area of the triangle can be simplified and should use absolute values to ensure a positive area. Ensure the vertices are considered in an anticlockwise direction for the formula to be valid.
