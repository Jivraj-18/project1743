So, now you have been presented with a equation
of line you are with an equation of line and a point and the question is you find the equation
of a line perpendicular to the line x minus 2 y plus 3 is equal to 0 and passing through
the point minus 1, 2. So, in this case let us identify the equation
what are the general form of the equation that is Ax plus B y plus C equal to 0 and
the you can easily see that A is equal to 1, B is equal to minus 2, C is equal to 3. Therefore the slope of the given line the
line that is given to you will be minus A by B which is minus of 1 upon minus of 2 that
will be 1/2. So, the slope of the given line m1 is equal
to half, now if at all a line is perpendicular to it then you already know that the product
of the slopes is minus 1 so the if the product of the slopes is minus 1 then m 2 m 1 into
m 2 is equal to minus 1 that is m 2 is equal to minus 1 upon m 1 so minus 1 upon m 1 m
1 is 1/2 which will give me m 2 to be equal to minus 2. So now the problem reduces to the slope of
a given line is minus 2 and it passes through point minus 1, 2 and I want to find the equation
of a line that is passing through point minus 1, 2 and hat slope two minus 2. So, use the slope point form y minus y naught
is equal to m times x minus x naught, y naught is 2 so so you can easily see y minus 2 is
equal to minus 2 times x plus 1 x minus minus 1 so x plus 1, rearrange the terms so this
2 will get cancelled constant therefore I will get the equation of a line to be y is
equal to minus 2x or in a general form you can write this as minus 2x plus y is equal
to 0 ok. So let us let us try to figure out whether
it is perpendicular the line; which we have actually figured or found is perpendicular
or not. So, the orange line is the line for which
the equation is given x minus 2y plus 3 is equal to 0 the point minus 1, 2 is displayed
in the graph and the line passing through it is also displayed and you can clearly see
the angle that is made is 90 degrees therefore the lines are perpendicular and our answer
is correct. So, our verification test has passed.
